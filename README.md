# What is ShrivBot 

Shrivbot is a discord bot that keeps track of a score for a discord user. This score starts off at 500 but can change to be between 0 (Bad) to 1000 (Good) depending on how that user acts.  

This score is globally tracked throughout all servers that a user is in allowing moderators to easily see when a user is going to be not right for that server immediately or maybe their a perfect fit depending on the server.
